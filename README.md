Data science New York City rent analysis,
Project overview: 

-Using a dataset provided by Streateasy and Codecademy, created various pivot tables, bar graphs, and scatter plots that highlight important trends in the dataset.

-Created a tool that outlines the cost of rent in the boroughâ€™s Queens, Manhattan, and Brooklyn 

-Used a multiple linear regression model to predict the price of rent given multiple independent variables such as square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms

-Created a function that assigned a score out of 100 for apartments that contained items that are typically considered essentials. Our score function added 40 points if the apartment had an elevator, 20 points for a dishwasher, 30 for an in-unit washer and dryer, and 10 points for a doorman.

-Optimized the dataset for a potential apartment renter looking for a 1 bedroom  or studio apartment to get an ideal price within the borough and neighbored they are looking for. 

-Calculated the mean absolute error  for each borough to evaluate the accuracy of our multiple linear regression model.
